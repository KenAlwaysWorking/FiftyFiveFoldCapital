# AI Scenarios Assessment — 55F Framework

## Overview
Two core scenarios dominate the AI-driven economic transition:

---

## Scenario A — Uncoordinated “Profit-First” Adoption
**Description:**  
AI deployment focuses on cost-cutting without synchronized transition for displaced workers, leading to demand erosion and systemic instability.

**Timeline & Effects:**
| Horizon | Automation Level | Median Income | Demand | Inequality | Market Risk |
|---------|------------------|---------------|--------|------------|-------------|
| 0–4 yrs | 10–40% tasks automated | ↓ 3–8% | ↓ 2–6% | ↑↑ | High correction risk |
| 5–10 yrs | 40–60% tasks automated | ↓ 8–15% | ↓ 5–12% | ↑↑↑ | Volatile margins, credit stress |

**Investment Impacts:**
- Winners: Quality equities, long-duration gov bonds, defensive staples, early AI picks & shovels.
- Laggards: Cyclicals, ad-revenue media, small caps with leverage.
- Tactics: Barbell allocation (quality + duration), high cash, hedging via puts/collars.

**Policy Gaps:**
- No demand recycling (UBI/dividends).
- Concentrated AI ownership.
- Reactive, fragmented regulation.

## Scenario B — Coordinated Regenerative Adoption
**Description:**  
AI deployment paced with transition incomes, broad asset ownership, and demand maintenance.

**Timeline & Effects:**
| Horizon | Automation Level | Median Income | Demand | Inequality | Market Risk |
|---------|------------------|---------------|--------|------------|-------------|
| 0–4 yrs | 10–20% automated | ↑ 1–3% | ↑ 2–4% | ↔ | Low |
| 5–10 yrs | 25–40% automated | ↑ 3–7% | ↑ 4–8% | ↔/↓ | Low–Med |
| 10–20 yrs | 40–60% automated | ↑ 7–15% | ↑ 6–12% | ↓ | Low |

**Investment Impacts:**
- Winners: Experience economy, healthcare/longevity, human-centric education, resilient infra.
- Laggards: Narrow capital oligopolies (due to policy break-up).
- Tactics: Gradual rotation into growth & SMIDs, infra REITs, and frontier innovation.

**Policy Levers:**
- UBI or citizen dividends.
- Public/civic stakes in AI platforms.
- Antitrust & interoperability mandates.
- Demand-coupled automation pacing.

## Tripwires to Monitor
1. Labor share of income (↓ fast → Scenario A).
2. Household consumption vs corporate savings (decoupling → Scenario A).
3. Breadth of AI asset ownership (broadening → Scenario B).
4. Policy velocity (UBI/data dividend/worker equity pilots → Scenario B).
5. Market breadth (narrowing → Scenario A stress).
