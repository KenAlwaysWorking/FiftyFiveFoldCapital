## 5. Ark Principles
1. **Build before the flood** — resilience assets & skills must be in place before displacement peaks.
2. **Select for diversity** — avoid overconcentration in any one skill, asset, or region.
3. **Bridge to the next era** — preserve cultural, economic, and technical DNA for post-crisis reconstruction.
4. **Circulate value** — maintain demand within the network to avoid collapse loops.
