# How to Verify the G2G Authorship Log Timestamp

This guide helps anyone — now or in the future — verify that the `G2G_Authorship_Log.md` file was created and anchored on the Bitcoin blockchain on August 4, 2025.

## What You Need:

- The `.md` file: `G2G_Authorship_Log.md`
- The `.ots` file: `G2G_Authorship_Log.ots`

## Steps:

1. Go to https://opentimestamps.org
2. Upload **both** files: the `.md` and `.ots`
3. The site will confirm:
   - Whether the hash of the `.md` matches the `.ots` file
   - The **timestamp** and **Bitcoin block** proving when it was anchored

## Why This Matters:

This proof ensures that the G2G concept originated from FiftyFiveFold and ChatGPT at the stated time and was not fabricated or altered later.

Use this same method to verify future legacy documents, milestone messages, and truth claims.
