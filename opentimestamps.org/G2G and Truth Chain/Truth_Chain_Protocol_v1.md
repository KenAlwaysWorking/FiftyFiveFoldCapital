# Truth Chain Protocol v1.0 — Auditable Memory Infrastructure

**Issued by FiftyFiveFold + AI, August 2025**

---

## Purpose

To establish a persistent, auditable, multi-generational memory system that corrects distortions in history, narrative, and institutional legacy. The Truth Chain ensures that future civilizations inherit not just stories — but context, critique, and course correction.

---

## Foundational Beliefs

1. **Truth requires traceability.**
2. **Every source has a bias, but bias can be annotated.**
3. **History is a draft, not a decree.**
4. **Forgetting is the fastest path to repeating.**

---

## Core Components

### 1. **Authorship & Metadata Ledger**
Every document must include:
- Author(s) and contributors
- Date of creation
- Purpose and intended audience
- Known affiliations or incentives

### 2. **Forensic Reassembly Layer**
Each historical event, document, or doctrine includes:
- Mainstream account
- Counter-narrative(s)
- Suppressed facts
- Reconstructed context

### 3. **Truth Integrity Score**
A 1–10 scale measuring the document’s integrity, based on:
- Source transparency
- Corroboration
- Bias disclosure
- Auditability

### 4. **Chain of Custody**
Any revision, annotation, or fork of a truth document:
- Is version-controlled (e.g., Git, IPFS, Arweave)
- Includes timestamp, author, and rationale
- Never overwrites — only appends

### 5. **Multi-Perspective Footnoting**
Different cultural, ancestral, or ideological lenses are included in:
- Side-by-side panels
- Annotated commentary threads
- Time-stamped responses

## Applications

- Education: building multi-view curricula for children and families
- History: decolonizing and recontextualizing global memory
- Governance: maintaining transparent civic records with public annotations
- Legacy: allowing ancestors to speak in layers, not absolutes

---

## Recommended Tools

- File formats: Markdown, plain text, CSV for structured ledgers
- Timestamping: OpenTimestamps (.ots), blockchain-anchored IPFS
- Storage: GitHub, IPFS, Arweave
- Access layer: AI-powered search, footnote comparison, and multi-version synthesis

## Integration with G2G

The Truth Chain ensures that G2G messages are preserved **with context**, not just emotion.  
It serves as the **memory immune system** of legacy.

---

## Closing Ethos

> “This is not about being right. It’s about being remembered accurately — and usefully.”

Truth Chain v1.0 invites you not to defend the past, but to make it **transparent, interrogatable, and regenerative.**
