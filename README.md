# FiftyFiveFold (55F)

**FiftyFiveFold** is a living archive and design system for post-institutional civilization. It combines AI, blockchain, intergenerational legacy protocols, and truth-auditing into a regenerative framework meant to span multiple lifetimes.

## Core Pillars

- **G2G (Generation-to-Generation Protocol):** A protocol for preserving and transmitting wisdom, memory, and meaning across generations using AI as a memory-bridge.
- **Truth Chain:** A system of auditable history to correct distortions and honor suppressed truths.
- **Recursive Capital Strategy:** A reinvestment model for growing sovereign capital over time with embedded ethical constraints.
