# Ark Market Keystone Governance Charter

## 1. Purpose
This charter defines the foundational governance and revenue principles of the Ark Market. Its purpose is to ensure that the Ark remains regenerative, member-aligned, and resilient over time, avoiding the extractive patterns of existing "twisted form" marketplaces.

---

## 2. Core Mission
To connect and empower a trusted network of members to exchange skills, services, and resources in a way that:
- Retains and recirculates value within the community.
- Promotes long-term member viability and collective resilience.
- Avoids structural drift toward extraction or external control.

## 3. Keystone Principles

### 3.1 Governance Alignment
- All decision-making power rests with **member-elected councils** or assemblies.
- No governance seats may be sold, traded, or held by non-participating outside investors.
- Major decisions require **supermajority approval** (e.g., 70%+) from the member body.

### 3.2 Revenue Transparency & Proper Usage
- All revenue streams (fees, commissions, memberships, grants) must be openly reported to all members on at least a monthly basis.
- Use of funds must align with **pre-approved categories**:
  - Platform maintenance & improvement
  - Community marketing & outreach
  - Member training & skill development
  - Micro-grants or investment in new member services
- Prohibited usage: Any disbursement to external shareholders not actively participating in the Ark.

### 3.3 Value Loop Closure
- Members are encouraged and incentivized to re-spend within the Ark.
- Commission structures are kept low and reinvested into member-benefit initiatives.
- Services and goods offered should, where possible, fulfill member needs without defaulting to external suppliers.

### 3.4 Member Stake & Accountability
- Each active member is considered a stakeholder with:
  - Voting rights
  - Access to transparent financial records
  - Ability to propose and vote on initiatives
- Members agree to uphold quality and trust standards to maintain market reputation.

### 3.5 Adaptation Protocols
- The Ark must review governance rules annually.
- Amendments require member approval by supermajority.
- Emergency changes may be enacted temporarily (max 90 days) but must be ratified by members.

---

## 4. Safeguards Against "Twisted Form"
To avoid the pitfalls of existing platforms:
- **No external dependency**: Core systems and infrastructure are community-owned or controlled.
- **No hidden fees or algorithmic choke points**: All ranking/matching systems must be transparent and auditable.
- **No race-to-the-bottom pricing**: The Ark may set minimum pricing floors to maintain service quality and member sustainability.

---

## 5. Enforcement
- Violations of this charter are subject to member-led review and possible sanctions (suspension, removal).
- Governance and transparency audits must be conducted annually by an independent committee of members.

---

## 6. Ratification
This charter is binding upon all members upon joining the Ark Market.
